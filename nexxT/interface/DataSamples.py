        Import this class with :code:`from nexxT.interface import DataSample`.

    This class is used for storing a data sample of the nexxT framework. For most generic usage, a QByteArray is used
    for the storage. This means that deserialization has to be performed on every usage and data generators need to
    serialize the data. Assumes that serializing / deserializing are efficient operations.

    DataSample instances additionally have a type, which is a string and it should uniquely define the serialization
    method. Last but not least, an integer timestamp is stored for all DataSample instances.

    .. note::
        Usually, nexxT is using the wrapped C++ class instead of the python version. In python there are no
        differences between the wrapped C++ class and this python class. The C++ interface is defined in
