class PropertyCollection(QObject):
    """
    .. note::
        Import this class with :code:`from nexxT.interface import PropertyCollection`.

    This class represents a collection of properties. These collections are organized in a tree, such that there
    are parent/child relations. This is a generic base class, which is implemented in the core package. Access to
    properties throug the methods below is thread safe.

    Properties are usually used in subclasses of :py:class:`nexxT.interface.Filters.Filter`. They are presented in the
    GUI as editable entities and the settings are saved to the configuration file. They are defined during filter
    constructor and onInit(...), they can be used during the whole filter lifecycle. There is also the possibility
    to connect a callback function to the :py:attr:`propertyChanged` signal. Note that properties are
    automatically deleted from the config file if they disappear (e.g., due to code changes, changed dynamic ports,
    etc.).

    Example::

        class MyFilter(Filter):
            def __init__(self, env):
                super().__init__(False, False, env)
                pc = self.propertyCollection()
                pc.defineProperty("intProp", 1, "an unconstrained integer")
                pc.defineProperty("intPropMax", 1, "an max constrained integer", options=dict(max=10))
                pc.defineProperty("intPropBounded", 1, "a bounded integer", options=dict(min=-4, max=10))
                pc.defineProperty("floatProp", 1.0, "a floating point number", options=dict(min=-1e-4, max=10000))
                pc.defineProperty("boolProp", True, "a boolean")
                # it is also possible to connect a callback
                pc.propertyChanged.connect(self.onPropertyChanged)

            def onInit(self):
                pc = self.propertyCollection()
                pc.defineProperty("strProp", "Hello World", "a string")
                pc.defineProperty("enumProp", "Hello", "a string", options=dict(enum=["Hello", "World"]))

            def onStart(self):
                # queries the current value of the property
                pc = self.propertyCollection()
                intProp = pc.getProperty("intProp")
                # ...

            def onPropertyChanged(self, pc, name):
                logger.info("Property '%s' changed to %s", name, repr(pc.getProperty(name)))

    In the above example, different editors will be created apropriate to the chosen values. For example, the enum
    property can be edited using a combo box while integer properties are edited with spin boxes. It is also possible
    to adapt this behaviour by passing custom propertyHandlers.

    This class is an abstract base class.
